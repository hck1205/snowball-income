# Snowball Income - Full LLM Context

## Product Definition
Snowball Income is a web-based dividend strategy simulator focused on long-term portfolio income planning.
It helps users model how initial capital, monthly investments, dividend assumptions, and portfolio allocation choices affect
future asset value and dividend cashflow.

## Core Use Cases
1. Estimate how long it may take to reach a target monthly dividend.
2. Compare scenarios with and without dividend reinvestment.
3. Inspect yearly trends for assets, annual dividends, and cumulative dividends.
4. Review recent 12-month payout composition by ticker.
5. Tune ticker weights and lock/unlock fixed-weight positions.

## Input Model
- Portfolio:
  - ticker profiles (ticker symbol, initial price, dividend yield, dividend growth, price growth, payout frequency)
  - included ticker ids
  - weight map by ticker id
  - fixed weight flags by ticker id
- Investment settings:
  - initial investment (lump-sum)
  - monthly contribution
  - target monthly dividend
  - investment start date (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
  - duration years
  - reinvest dividends (boolean)
  - tax rate (%)
  - reinvest timing (`sameMonth` or `nextMonth`)
  - dividend growth mode (`annualStep` or `monthlySmooth`)

## Output Model
- Simulation summary:
  - final asset value
  - final monthly average dividend
  - final payout-month dividend
  - total net dividend
  - total tax paid
  - target-reach year for monthly dividend
- Quick estimate summary:
  - end value
  - annual dividend approximation
  - monthly dividend approximation
  - yield-on-price at end
- Visual outputs:
  - allocation pie chart
  - recent 12-month cashflow stacked bar chart
  - yearly series line chart
  - optional split charts for monthly dividend, asset value, cumulative dividend

## Interpretation Guidance
- The simulator is deterministic for a given input set.
- It is designed for scenario exploration, not prediction certainty.
- Growth/yield assumptions are user-provided and can materially change outcomes.
- This is not financial, tax, or legal advice.
